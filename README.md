# MNIST Digit Classification with SVM

Welcome to the MNIST Digit Classification project! This repository contains a machine learning model that classifies handwritten digits using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with an impressive accuracy of 99%.

## Project Overview

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits, commonly used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. This project aims to accurately classify these images into the correct digit categories.

## Model Details

- **Algorithm**: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Accuracy**: 99%
- **Dataset**: MNIST

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamadAlemiAI/mnistSVM.git
cd mnist-svm
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the mnist_classification.py script to train the SVM model and evaluate its performance on the MNIST test dataset.

python mnist_classification.py

Visualization
The following image shows a subset of the MNIST dataset used for training the SVM model.
